# DataSift stream consumer for NodeJS

This library gives easy access to the real-time data coming from a DataSift stream.

It connects to the DataSift streaming API, and emits all data received, automatically reconnecting as necessary.

Note that this module is promise based (via the Q library) and event based (via the EventEmitter).

## Prerequisites
- You have a DataSift account (username and API key) available from http://datasift.com

## Install
- Using npm `npm install datasift`
- Add it to your project `require('datasift.js');`

## Use

###create(username, apiKey, hostname, port)
Factory method which returns a DataSift instance

    //Create a datasift instance via the factory method like:
    var ds = DataSift.create('YOUR_ACCOUNT', 'YOUR_API_KEY');
###subscribe(streamHash)
Starts listening to the specific streams hashes given, putting the driver into the state passed in.
Multiple streams can be subscribed to per DataSift instance.  Overloaded so that either a string of single hash or an object keyed on the datasift hash

    var streams = ({'YOUR_STREAM_HASH_1' : {name: hash1}, 'YOUR_STREAM_HASH_2 : {name : hash2}, â€¦ YOUR_STREAM_HASH_N : {name: hashN});

    ds.subscribe(streams).then(
        function(resultingPromises) {
            resultingPromises.forEach( function(promise) {
            if(promise.isFulfilled()) {
                //promise.valueOf().name subscribed
            } else {
                //failed with reason promise.valueOf.exception
            }
	    }});
###unsubscribe(streamHash)
Unsubscribes to a stream already subscribed by the underlying connection to DataSift

    ds.unsubscribe('YOUR_STREAM_HASH').then(
        function() {
            //successfully unsubscribed
        }, function() {
            //failed to unsubscribe
        });
###shutdown()
Stop and disconnects to the DataSift stream.

    ds.shutdown();
###Putting it all together
See also the example.js file.

    var DataSift = require('datasift');

    // create a datasift instance via the factory method
    var ds = DataSift.create('YOUR_ACCOUNT', 'YOUR_API_KEY');

    ds.on('interaction', function (message) {
        //process the message;
    });

    // start listening to the stream:

    ds.subscribe(streams).then(
        function(resultingPromises) {
            resultingPromises.forEach( function(promise) {
		if(promise.isFulfilled()) {
			//promise.valueOf().hash subscribed
		} else {
			//failed with reason promise.valueOf.exception
		}
	    }
        });


## events emitted
###interaction(data)
    The interaction data collected from the DataSift stream.
###tick
    A tick event from DataSift, used to let the DataSift client know that the connection is still live.
###success
    A success event from DataSift.
###warning(message)
    Warnings about the state of the driver, bad status codes from the server, or incorrectly formatted JSON.
###connect
    The driver is connected to a DataSift stream.
###delete(data)
    A tweet was deleted on twitter and needs to be deleted by the client, if you are persisting the tweet interaction.
###error(error)
    Error coming from the DataSift stream.
####unknownEvent(data)
    An event coming from DataSift which its status cannot be determined.
###debug(message)
    Information relating the transition in state of the driver.  Used for debugging purposes.
